## What is Tapjoy?
Tapjoy is an advertising and app monetisation platform that offers a novel way for users to engage in mobile advertising. Instead of clicking on banner ads, Tapjoy offers users virtual currency for watching video ads, subscribing to services, and downloading promoted apps. Users can then spend that virtual currency on unlocking in-app content from publishers.
Tapjoy offers developers a way to monetise users who do not have credit cards or do not wish to spend real currency on app content. For brands and advertisers, the networkâ€™s Pay Per Engagement model offers a unique way to distribute apps and collect market data, and potentially offers a more reliable ROI than typical CPC or CPM networks.
